  Dialogue:
  - 'Cain: "Hey, that''s your fourth sausage already! Leave some for me."'
  - 'Jack: "I''m a big guy. I need a lot of food for sustenance. I''m twice your
    size, little man."'
  - 'Cain: "That''s why you need to leave some for me! Otherwise I''ll stay little
    forever, and all the other boys will pick on me."'
  - 'Jack: "Knowing you, they''d come to regret that. You''ll be fine, Cain. You''ll
    grow up tall and strong, just like me."'
  - 'Cain: "Jack?" '
  - 'Jack: "Yes?"'
  - 'Cain: "Do you sometimes wish that you could just... stay in one moment, and
    never leave?"'
  - 'Jack: "... sometimes. yeah. But life keeps on moving. We gotta keep up, little
    man, or we''ll get too far behind."'
  - 'Cain: "Jack?"'
  - 'Jack: "Yes, little man?"'
  - 'Cain: "I''m scared. Scared of growing up. Of things changing. Of us never being
    the same again. Of you leaving, and never coming back."'
  - 'Cain: "I''m scared of you thinking that you''re too old for me. That you''ll
    have more important things to do and won''t have time for me anymore."'
  - 'Jack: "Hey, don''t cry now, Cain. It''s alright. I promise you, we''ll stay
    together no matter what. Whatever happens, nothing will change the way I feel
    about you, okay?"'
  - 'Cain: "Okay."'
