  Dialogue:
  - "Cain: (whispering) \"Jack\u2026 is that\u2026 an elk?\""
  - "Jack: (also whispering) \"It\u2019s enormous! I didn\u2019t think they got that
    big.\""
  - "Jack: \"Do you think it\u2019s dangerous?.\""
  - "Jack: \"I don\u2019t know\u2026 It looks kind of calm, though. Look at its eyes\u2014they\u2019re
    completely black!\""
  - "Cain: (taking a small step forward) \"Maybe it\u2019s friendly?\""
  - "Jack: (grabbing Cain\u2019s arm) \"Maybe it\u2019s hungry! Don\u2019t get too
    close. What if it thinks you're a snack?\""
  - "Cain: \"I don\u2019t think it eats kids, Jack.\""
  - "Jack: \"Hmm, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re pretty small. He could chew you
    right up!\""
  - "Cain: \"Well, you\u2019re taller. You\u2019d make a better meal. I'm gonna try
    and pet it.\""
  - "Cain: \"Fine, then. But if it chases us, I\u2019m tripping you.\""
  - (Cain takes another cautious step forward, and the elk lowers its head slightly,
    as if to inspect him. The elk then snorts softly, shakes its antlers, and lazily
    munches on some grass.)
  - 'Cain: "See? Totally harmless. I bet he''d make a good pet."'
  - 'Jack: "Oh yeah? And where would you keep him, silly?"'
  - 'Cain: "In our room, of course! He could sleep in your bed. I bet he doesn''t
    snore as much as you do." '
