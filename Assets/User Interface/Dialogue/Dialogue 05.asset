  Dialogue:
  - 'Jack: "Oh, Cain, it''s so good to see you! We''re lucky you''re safe and well.
    What got into your mind, running off like that? Don''t you ever do that again!"'
  - "Cain: \"You didn\u2019t have to come, Jack. This was my journey to take. I needed
    to do this.\""
  - "Jack: \"Your journey? What are you talking about? We\u2019ve been climbing this
    mountain together our whole lives. Why did you leave me behind like that?\""
  - "Cain: \"Because I needed to prove something! To myself. To you. To everyone
    who thinks I\u2019ll always be in your shadow.\""
  - "Cain: \"You don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, Jack\u2014being normal.
    Watching you do things I can\u2019t even dream of.\""
  - "Jack: \"Oh, Cain. I might have magic, but your grit and determination? You push
    yourself further than I ever could. You don\u2019t need magic to prove your worth\u2014you
    never did.\""
  - "Jack: \"Look at where you are. You made it all the way to the summit. You got
    here by yourself\u2014no shortcuts, no magic. That\u2019s something I could never
    do.\""
  - "\"But I\u2026 I wanted to be better. I wanted to show you I could stand beside
    you for once, not behind you. I\u2019m tired of everyone thinking I\u2019m weak!\""
  - "Jack: \"Brother, you\u2019ll always mean the world to me, and nothing will ever
    change that. Don\u2019t listen to the naysayers. I believe in you\u2014always.
    You can do anything you set your mind to.\""
  - 'Cain: "Thanks, Jack. I really needed to hear that. I''m sorry I ran away. I''m
    sorry for everything."'
  - 'Jack: "There is nothing to be sorry about. Now, let''s get off this mountain,
    before you freeze to death. I''ll make you hot chocolate when we get home."'
  - 'Cain: "I would love that."'
