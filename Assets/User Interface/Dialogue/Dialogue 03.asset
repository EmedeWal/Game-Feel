  Dialogue:
  - 'Jack: Just gonna catch my breath for a minute. I don''t remember it being this
    difficult. Now that I think of it, this has been the farthest up the mountain
    we ever got.'
  - 'Jack: How did you even get this far, Cain? You''re just a normal kid, but I
    can''t even compete. The hero of the frost, completely outmatched by his younger
    brother.'
  - 'Jack: I''m proud of you, brother, you know that? None of this has been easy
    on you, on us. And yet, you never surrender. Hold on to that, and you''ll reach
    the summit.'
