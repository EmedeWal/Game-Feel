  Dialogue:
  - 'Jack: It seems I am following in your footsteps this time, Cain. Funny. In all
    of our years as brothers, this is the first time I shall scale the mountain alone.'
  - 'Jack: Why are you so eager to prove yourself? The only one who even doubts your
    abilities is you. And yet, here you are again, pushing yourself to the limit.'
  - 'Jack: No matter. The snow''s getting worse. I really ought to hurry if I want
    to catch up with you. I bet you mom and dad are worried about you. Let''s get
    you home. '
