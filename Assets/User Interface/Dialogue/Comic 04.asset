  Dialogue:
  - 'Jack: There it is. The summit. It feels so close now. And yet, you are nowhere
    to be seen. It seems I am still two steps behind you, brother. I just hope you
    are alright.'
  - 'Jack: It is beautiful up here. I can see why you like it so much. Despite the
    harsh winds, the sharp rocks and the cold snow, this place is quiet, peaceful,
    and fair.'
  - 'Jack: I''m coming up. No doubt that this will be the hardest part yet, but we
    have come this far. We are not backing down now. I''ll meet you at the top, Cain! '
