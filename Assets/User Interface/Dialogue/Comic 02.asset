  Dialogue:
  - 'Jack: This place holds many memories. The secrets we uncovered, the challenges
    we conquered together... it felt like the world was ours. It isn''t the same
    without you, Cain.'
  - 'Jack: It all seems so long ago now. I sometimes wish things could go back to
    the way they were. Before I became... different. Before mom and dad loved us
    unequally. '
  - 'Jack: These adventures I had with you were some of the best days of my life.
    I''ll never forget them, brother. No matter what happens. I won''t give up on
    us.'
